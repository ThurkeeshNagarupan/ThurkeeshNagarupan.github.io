      <h2>The trouble with Bears</h2>
      <p>By Evan Wild</p>
      <p>
        Tall, lumbering, angry, dangerous. The real live bears of this world are proud, independent creatures, 
        self-serving and always on the hunt for food. Nothing like the bears you see on TV, like Baloo from 
        the renowned documentary, *The Jungle Book*.
      </p>
      <p>
        So what are bears really like, and why does the world's media portray them with such a skewed vision? 
        In this article, we try to answer those questions and give you a real insight into the life of the bear.
      </p>

      <h3>Types of bear</h3>
      <p>
        Bears come in two varieties — large and medium. You don't get small bears. If you have seen a small bear, 
        then it was in fact probably a baby bear (cub) from another species.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bears can also be classified in terms of their habitat — both large and medium bears are just as at home 
        in urban areas as they are in the countryside. Different habitats encourage different behavior, as you'll 
        find out below. The table below also gives you some useful facts about bears.
      </p>

            <td>Starbucks, sushi</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h3>Habitats and Eating habits</h3>
      <p>
        Wild bears eat a variety of meat, fish, fruit, nuts, and other naturally growing ingredients. In general, 
        they will hunt for food themselves in woodland or rivers, but at a push, they will track down their sustenance 
        from farms or country houses. They tend to live in relative isolation, in caves, tents, or cottages.
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>
        Urban (gentrified) bears, on the other hand, have largely abandoned the old ways. They will hunt other 
        urban creatures if necessary (including other predators like rats and foxes), but prefer to scavenge from 
        readily available urban food outlets like dumpsters, bins, and fast food joints. When food has proven scarce, 
        urban bears have even been known to break into people's kitchens and steal essentials like baked beans, 
        ready meals, and microwave ovens.

      <h3>Mating rituals</h3>
      <p>
        Bears are romantic creatures by nature, and will naturally look for a mate that they can spend the rest 
        of their lives with. They will woo a potential suitor by making their dwelling look attractive — for example, 
        with cave paintings or a bed of reeds in the case of a wild bear, and mood lighting and a Michael Bublé CD 
        in the case of an urban bear.

              Oh, I am so glad you taught me all about the big brown angry guys in the woods. With their sniffing 
              little noses and their bad attitudes, they can sure be a menace — I was thinking of putting them all 
              in a truck and driving them outta here. I run a zoo, you know.
