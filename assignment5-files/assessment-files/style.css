      <h2>The trouble with Bears</h2>
      <p><strong>By Evan Wild</strong></p>
      <p>Tall, lumbering, angry, dangerous. The real live bears of this world are proud, independent creatures, self-serving and always on the hunt for food. Nothing like the bears you see on TV, like Baloo from renowned documentary, <em>The Jungle Book</em>.</p>
      <p>So what are bears really like, and why does the world's media portray them with such a skewed vision? In this article, we try to answer those questions and give you a real insight into the life of the bear.</p>

      <h3>Types of bear</h3>
      <p>Bears come in two varieties — large and medium. You don't get small bears. If you have seen a small bear, then it was in fact probably a baby bear (cub) from another species.</p>
      <p>Bears can also be classified in terms of their habitat — both large and medium bears are just as at home in urban areas as they are in the countryside. Different habitats encourage different behavior, as you'll find out below. The table below also gives you some useful facts about bears.</p>

      <table>
        <caption>Types of Bears and Their Characteristics</caption>
        <thead>
          <tr>

            <td>1.4 to 2.8 meters</td>
            <td>Woods and forests</td>
            <td>25 to 28 years</td>
            <td>Fish, meat, plants</td>
          </tr>

            <td>Urban</td>
            <td>North Face</td>
            <td>1.8 to 2.2 meters</td>
            <td>Condos and coffee shops</td>
            <td>20 to 32 years</td>
            <td>Starbucks, sushi</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h3>Habitats and Eating Habits</h3>
      <p>Wild bears eat a variety of meat, fish, fruit, nuts, and other naturally growing ingredients. They tend to live in relative isolation, in caves, tents, or cottages.</p>

      <p>Urban bears have largely abandoned the old ways. They scavenge from urban food outlets like dumpsters, bins, and fast food joints. Urban bears will sleep anywhere they can, from bus shelters to parks or their own apartments.</p>

      <h3>Mating rituals</h3>
      <p>Bears are romantic creatures by nature and will woo a potential suitor by making their dwelling look attractive. Wild bears use cave paintings, while urban bears might use mood lighting and a Michael Bublé CD.</p>
